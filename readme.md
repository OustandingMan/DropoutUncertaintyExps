# DropoutUncertaintyExps
`DropoutUncertaintyExps` contains codes for the experiments in the paper ["Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation: Representing Model Uncertainty in Deep Learning" (2015)](https://link.iamblogger.net/bdlpaper). This forked repository the original code plus [`experiment.ipynb`](https://link.iamblogger.net/5pr5j), an adapted Jupyter Notebook version of [`experiment.py`](https://link.iamblogger.net/11n7m), and my own test results.
