# DropoutUncertaintyExps
This repository contains a **fork** of the original source codes for the experiments in the paper by Gal and Ghahramani ["Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation: Representing Model Uncertainty in Deep Learning" (2015)](https://link.iamblogger.net/bdlpaper). This forked repository contains the original code plus [`experiment.ipynb`](https://link.iamblogger.net/5pr5j) - an adapted Jupyter Notebook version of [`experiment.py`](https://link.iamblogger.net/11n7m), and my own test results.
